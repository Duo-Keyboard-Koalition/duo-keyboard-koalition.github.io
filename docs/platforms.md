## Links

| Platform | Purpose | Link |
|----------|---------|------|

## The stack: River + Luma

- **River (GetRiver)** — Infrastructure / “main office”: community hub, global map, propose meetups, join the Koalition.
- **Luma** — Interface / “storefront”: event pages, QR check-in, Add to Calendar, mobile RSVP.

**Hierarchy:** River (parent) → Luma (child). Your River community page is the main hub; each Luma event is a storefront.

## How it works

1. **Create on Luma** — Set up the event page (RSVPs, ticketing, reminders).
2. **Post on River** — In River, add the event and paste your Luma URL in the description or external link.
3. **Scale** — Members in other cities propose meetups on River; once approved, they link their own Luma page for that city.

## Why use both?

- **Luma:** Visual trust, premium event pages, great mobile RSVP.
- **River:** Community data, “propose a meetup,” see where your community is densest.
- **Both:** Better discovery (Luma Discover + River Community search).

## Pro tip: Zapier / Make.com

- **Trigger:** New RSVP on Luma  
- **Action:** Add member to River (or Discord/Slack)  

That way anyone who finds you via a Luma event is onboarded into the wider Duo Keyboard Koalition ecosystem.
